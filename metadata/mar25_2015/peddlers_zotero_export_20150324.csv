Hirsz Abramowicz (1881-1960), a prominent Jewish educator, writer, and cultural activist, knew that world and wrote about it, and his writings provide a rare eyewitness account of Jewish life during the first half of the twentieth century."" ""Abramowicz was a witness to war, revolution, and major cultural transformations in the Jewish world. His essays, written and originally published in Yiddish between 1920 and 1955, document the local history of Lithuanian Jewry in rural and small-town settings and in the city of Vilna - the ""Jerusalem of Lithuania"" - which was a major center of East European Jewish intellectual and cultural life. They shed important light on the daily life of Jews and the flourishing of modern Yiddish culture in Eastern Europe during the early twentieth century and offer a personal perspective on the rise of Jewish radical politics.""--BOOK JACKET."	1999	10/13/2014 16:02	12/1/2014 19:21													Wayne State University Press	Detroit	English					Open WorldCat		jp_cite_00006						"Abramowicz, Dina"		"Dobkin, Eva Zeitlin"	"Shandler, Jeffrey; Fishman, David E"

The author considers these immigrants a branch of German Jewry, compelled to seek overseas the political and civil rights denied them at home. In this volume of the Ellis Island Series, the fascinating story of this mass immigration of mostly poor, enterprising, young people is told in vivid detail. Drawing on rare letters, diaries, memoirs, period newspapers, journals, and other firsthand accounts, Barkai traces the process of family-oriented chain migration, resettlement, and acculturation, exploring as well the group's relations with the Jewish community in Germany and with German and Jewish immigrants in the New World. Often starting out as peddlers and storekeepers, the immigrants moved back and forth from East Coast towns and cities to settlements in the South, Midwest, and Far West, helping to expand the American frontier and to develop cities such as Cincinnati St. Louis, Milwaukee, and San Francisco. The narrative chronicles their experiences in the goldfields of California, on Indian reservations, and during the Civil War, in which German-Jewish soldiers in the Union and Confederate armies struggled against bigotry to assert their civil rights. These engaging personal narratives are woven into an account of the formative role played by German-Jewish immigrants in establishing the institutional framework of the American-Jewish community. Their influential network of mutual aid and philanthropic organizations would be challenged, at the turn of the century, by the great mass migration of Jews from Eastern Europe. The author's presentation of the dramatic encounter between these two groups sheds new light not only on this critical period in American-Jewish history but also on the dynamics of cultural change in a pluralist society."	1994	2/24/2014 19:53	12/9/2014 22:08								Branching out					Holmes & Meier	New York	English					Open WorldCat		jp_cite_00080

The period had started with the partition of Poland and the absorption of its territories into the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires; it would end with the first large-scale outbreaks of anti-Semitic violence and the imposition in Russia of strong anti-Semitic legislation. In the years between, a traditional society accustomed to an autonomous way of life would be transformed into one much more open to its surrounding cultures, yet much more confident of its own nationalist identity. In The Jews of Eastern Europe, Israel Bartal traces this transformation and finds in it the roots of Jewish modernity.""--BOOK JACKET."	2005	3/25/2014 15:39	12/15/2014 19:04													University of Pennsylvania Press	Philadelphia	eng					Open WorldCat		jp_cite_00088

The Miners of Windber chronicles the coming of unionization to Windber, from the 1890s, when thousands of new immigrants flooded Pennsylvania in search of work, through the New Deal era of the 1930s, when the miners' rights to organize, to join the United Mine Workers of America, and to bargain collectively were recognized after years of bitter struggle."" ""Mildred Allen Beik, a Windber native whose father entered the coal mines at age eleven in 1914, explores the struggle of miners and their families against the company, whose repressive policies encroached on every part of their lives. That Windber's population represented twenty-five different nationalities, including Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, and Carpatho-Russians, was a potential obstacle to the solidarity of miners. Beik, however, shows how the immigrants overcame ethnic fragmentation by banding together as a class to unionize the mines.

Some attention has also been paid to the way in which religions serve as a proxy for reputation or as a mechanism for enforcement of exchange agreements. These reputation and enforcement mechanisms enhance the ability of the members of certain religious groups to perform economic roles where such secular-based mechanisms fail or are absent. In this article, I explore the ways in which hostility toward members of high-tension religions makes them uniquely well suited to the economic role of middlemen. As illustration, I explore the particular case of the 19th-century German Jewish peddler in the young United States."	2007-11	1/11/2015 16:37	1/11/2015 16:40	1/11/2015 16:37	1005-1027		5	66		American Journal of Economics & Sociology	Hostile Territory												EBSCOhost		jp_cite_00129		C:\Users\dao269\AppData\Roaming\Zotero\Zotero\Profiles\sizhv72l.default\zotero\storage\4FM45W5K\Berndt - 2007 - Hostile Territory High-Tension Religion and the J.pdf

In this first of a two-volume work deals with population; staple diets throughout the world; housing and clothes; the spread of technology in particular, sources of power; communications; early economies and kinds of money; towns in East and West.

The sponsors of Jewish colonies in the USA did not strive for separation from general society. Rather, they sought to assist Jewish integration through settlement on the land.

HI6NDT77	book	1993	"Brownstein, Rachel M"	Tragic muse: Rachel of the Comédie-Française		0394574516 9780394574516				"Rachel Felix (1821-58), the homely daughter of poor Jewish peddlers, was the first stage actress to achieve international stardom - and the last person one would have expected to resurrect the cultural patrimony of France. Yet her passionate, startling performances of the works of Racine and Corneille saved them from almost certain obsolescence after the fall of Napoleon (who had relished classical French tragedy) and the emergence of Romanticism. Audiences in Paris, London, Boston, and Moscow thrilled to her voice, and devoured the rumors of her offstage promiscuity and extravagance. Her fame - equal parts popularity and notoriety - was so great that she could nonchalantly dispose of her last name. La grande Rachel virtually invented the role of the superstar, while remaining a symbol of the highest art and most serious cultural pursuits. Indeed, her identity was fraught with such contradictions - which intrigued the public all the more. From the moment she was discovered playing the guitar on the streets of Lyons, to her debut on the Parisian stage at the age of fifteen, to her critical and commercial triumphs as Camille, Phedre, and other tormented women, Rachel's career was exhaustively ""managed."" A series of theater gurus, influential reviewers, and impresarios - including her brash and opportunistic father - claimed the credit for her astonishing success. What this abundance of male managers has always obscured is Rachel's own decisiveness and control over her time and money - not only did she play her various champions (and high-profile lovers) against one another, she openly defied them. Some called her stubborn, even perverse; in these pages, we come to recognize her as a woman ahead of her time, a charismatic individual very much in charge of her own destiny. As her fascination with all things Napoleonic suggests, Rachel liked power - both personal and professional - and had the talent to command it. This remarkable biography (Rachel Brownstein's first book since the acclaimed Becoming a Heroine) explores the themes of Rachel's brief, intense life and appropriately tragic death, as well as her afterlife as a character in novels and a figure of legend. Rachel's appearances - more or less disguised - in Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, and Henry James are crucial to an understanding of her profound appeal. Combining brilliant literary analysis with impeccable historical research, favoring thematic coherence and narrative imagination over a strictly chronological treatment, Brownstein delivers the full impact of Rachel's personality and the full significance of her accomplishments."	1993	2/10/2015 17:18	2/10/2015 17:19								Tragic muse					A.A.

U5XQ8DF4	book	1992	"Bushman, Richard L"	"The refinement of America: persons, houses, cities"		0394550102 9780394550107				"In this illuminating analysis of early American society, Richard Bushman traces the introduction of gentility into the life of the nation. He explores the concern for stylishness, taste, beauty, and politeness that began to be felt in America after 1700, and examines how this concern changed our environment and culture. Bushman makes clear that the quest for gentility, far from being trivial, was the serious pursuit of a personal and social ideal with sources in classical and Renaissance literature. In Europe, the growing interest in manners and beautiful environments was connected to the power of royal courts. In America, the transformation of architecture, furnishings, and wardrobes - from plain, rudimentary, and frugal, to decorative and sumptuous - was linked to the transfer of power to the colonial gentry. Gentility was the culture of the colonies' ruling elite. After the Revolution, gentility spread to a broad middle class, as an essentially aristocratic culture was democratized. The change affected nearly every aspect of life. The spread of gentility turned the conduct of ordinary people into a performance. Courtesy books taught people how to hold their bodies, and how to dress, eat, and converse in a pleasing way. The wish to be pleasing came to encompass virtually every form of behavior and every aspect of the physical environment, from houses and yards to public buildings and the adornment of streets. Factories sprang up to supply a vast new market for furniture, dishes, curtains, and carpets. Cities and towns planted trees, landscaped parks and greens, and erected fashionable hotels and churches. All of these developments were part of a vast effort to present a refined face to the world and to create a new kind of society. Bushman stresses that these visions of a more elegant life both complemented and competed with other American values associated with evangelical religion, republicanism, capitalism, and the work ethic. The melding with other values resulted in contradictions that were not easily resolved and that provided much cultural work for writers and theologians. Finally, he argues that gentility gained strength from collaboration with capitalism, but in a way that blunted class conflict. The combination of capitalism, republicanism, and gentility prevented the hardening of class consciousness. Instead there emerged a belief in the right of every citizen to membership in the middle class."	1992	2/10/2015 20:39	2/10/2015 20:42								The refinement of America					Knopf : Distributed by Random House	New York	English					Open WorldCat		jp_cite_00200

Although the town declined when gold mining ended, several Jewish families started farms in the area, most notably Charles and Annie Greenberg. In 1914, another group arrived to form the Ferry County Farming and Stock Raising Company. In the end, the land proved unprofitable for farming, and most of the Jewish families left, unable to make a living or pay back loans. In its heyday the Jewish community at Republic had some 25 families, but it lacked the resources to make a permanent settlement."

Early immigrants came mostly from Bavaria. In the late 1860's and 1870's, more came from Prussia and Poland, creating some division in religious observance and class consciousness between Germans and Poles. In 1860, 30% of the Jewish males were married. As they prospered in business, many returned to Europe for wives. By 1880, over 54% were married.

Though this phenomenon has previously been analyzed from a strictly economic point of view, this book looks at street vending in the largest city in the world, Mexico City, as a political process. Employing a street-level analysis based on intensive participant observation, with interviews, archival research, and surveys, the author gives a view of political processes that provides new theoretical insights into our understanding of social movements, state institutions, and politics at the fringe of society, where legality blurs into illegality and the informal economy intersects with its political counterpoint - informal politics. By studying political processes at the street level and then tracing them up the political structure, the author also reveals the basic processes by which the Mexican state operates."	1998	3/4/2015 16:40	3/4/2015 16:47								Informal politics					Stanford University Press	"Stanford, Calif."
