The period had started with the partition of Poland and the absorption of its territories into the Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires; it would end with the first large-scale outbreaks of anti-Semitic violence and the imposition in Russia of strong anti-Semitic legislation. In the years between, a traditional society accustomed to an autonomous way of life would be transformed into one much more open to its surrounding cultures, yet much more confident of its own nationalist identity. In The Jews of Eastern Europe, Israel Bartal traces this transformation and finds in it the roots of Jewish modernity.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

		"abstract": "\"The history of the American West is being transformed by exciting new ideas, new questions, new scholarship. For many years this field was dominated by popular images of the lone cowboy and the savage Indian, and by Frederick Jackson Turner's concept of the frontier as a steadily advancing source of democracy and social renewal. But now historians and even the merchants of popular culture are reshaping our views of the frontier and the West by taking up a rich array of new subjects, including the stories of diverse peoples as well as the history of the land itself. A new generation of scholars is reformulating the broader questions also: what was the significance of the frontier in American history? what are the bases of western identity? what themes connect the twentieth-century West to its more distant past?\" \"The transformation of western history continues to be an open-ended, turbulent process. The original essays in this volume are reports from the frontier of change. In their diverging assumptions and conclusions, they reflect the vitality of this field. They succeed when they make the case for new questions and suggest possible answers. They advocate no single agenda. But taken together they well represent the passion and high craft with which scholars are creating a new western history.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

In this first of a two-volume work deals with population; staple diets throughout the world; housing and clothes; the spread of technology in particular, sources of power; communications; early economies and kinds of money; towns in East and West. The second volume will deal with the rise and expansion of capitalism.",

Robert Chazan argues that, while Jewish life in medieval Western Christendom was indeed beset with grave difficulties, it was nevertheless an environment rich in opportunities; the Jews of medieval Europe overcame obstacles, grew in number, explored innovative economic options, and fashioned enduring new forms of Jewish living. His research also provides a reconsideration of the legacy of medieval Jewish life, which is often depicted as equally destructive and projected as the underpinning of the twentieth-century catastrophes of antisemitism and the Holocaust. Dr Chazan's research proves that, although Jewish life in the medieval West laid the foundation for much Jewish suffering in the post-medieval world, it also stimulated considerable Jewish ingenuity, which lies at the root of impressive Jewish successes in the modern West\"-- \"This book reevaluates the prevailing notion that Jews in medieval Christian Europe lived under an appalling regime of ecclesiastical limitation, governmental exploitation and expropriation, and unceasing popular violence.

These fast-developing market economies resulted in a greater acceptance of Jewish merchants as business and civic allies.

Well established Jews developed schemes to settle recent Jewish immigrants on the soil. These schemes were characterized by unrealistic expectations, bad planning, and, when implemented, frequent failures. Yet, Jewish agricultural colonies must be distinguished from Christian, proto-Socialist or other utopian projects. The sponsors of Jewish colonies in the USA did not strive for separation from general society. Rather, they sought to assist Jewish integration through settlement on the land. The conceptual framework of Jewish productivization in America closely echoed the discourse of emancipation in Central Europe.",

His essays, written and originally published in Yiddish between 1920 and 1955, document the local history of Lithuanian Jewry in rural and small-town settings and in the city of Vilna - the \"Jerusalem of Lithuania\" - which was a major center of East European Jewish intellectual and cultural life. They shed important light on the daily life of Jews and the flourishing of modern Yiddish culture in Eastern Europe during the early twentieth century and offer a personal perspective on the rise of Jewish radical politics.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

In these small towns, Jewish citizens created networks of businesses and families that developed into a distinctive, nineteenth-century middle-class culture. As a minority group with a vital role in each community, Ohio Valley Jews fostered American religious pluralism as they constructed a regional identity. Their contributions to the culture and economy of the region countered the anti-Semitic sentiments of the period.",

		"event-place": "New York",
		"abstract": "This volume is one of the first historical studies of slavery in the United States to be presented from the perspective of the enslaved. This work contradicted those historians who had interpreted history to suggest that African American slaves were docile and submissive who enjoyed the benefits of a paternalistic master-slave relationship on Southern plantations. Using psychology, the author analyzes fugitive slave narratives published in the 19th century to conclude that an independent culture developed among the enslaved and that there were a variety of personality types exhibited by slaves. He asserts that by concentrating on the slave owner, historians have presented a distorted view of plantation life that \"strips the slave of any meaningful and distinctive culture, family life, religion, or manhood.\" \"The plantation was a battlefield where slaves fought masters for physical and psychological survival. Although unlettered, unarmed, and outnumbered, slaves fought in various ways to preserve their manhood.\" This impressive and original study views the institution of slavery from a new perspective- that of the slaves themselves. The author challenges the timeworn stereotype of the slave as a passive and docile creature who lacked drive, purpose, and responsibility. He traces the development of the slave's personality traits, analyzes the patterns of resistance within the slave community, and proves conclusively that the slave had a rich cultural and family life that was deliberately kept hidden from the eyes of his white masters. Unlike the many accounts that deal with slavery from the outside, this book ventures inside the slave quarters to re-capture the slave's family life, music, religion, and folklore. Using a variety of sources, including the memoirs of former slaves, the author examines the ways that blacks became enslaved, their process of acculturation in the American South, and their deep ties to their African heritage. He shows how the slave was able to control parts of his own life while often wearing the mask of submissiveness required by the harsh realities of the plantation regime. The author draws upon psychological and sociological insights to reinterpret master-slave relationships. He includes the planter's viewpoint and the traveler's impression to create a dimensional portrait of plantation life that effectively separates mythology from historical reality. -- from Book Jacket. The personality and culture of the plantation slave are investigated from black autobiographies and other historical sources.",

		"event-place": "New York",
		"abstract": "At a public picnic in the South in the 1890s, a young man paid five cents for his first chance to hear the revolutionary Edison talking machine. He eagerly listened as the soundman placed the needle down, only to find that through the tubes he held to his ears came the chilling sounds of a lynching. In this story, with its blend of new technology and old hatreds, genteel picnics and mob violence, Edward Ayers captures the history of the South in the years between  Reconstruction and the turn of the century - a combination of progress and reaction that defined the contradictory promise of the New South. Ranging from the Georgia coast to the Tennessee mountains, from the power brokers to tenant farmers, Ayers depicts a land of startling contrasts - a time of progress and repression, of new industries and old ways. Ayers takes us from remote Southern towns, revolutionized by the spread of the railroads, to the statehouses where Democratic \"Redeemers\" swept away the legacy of Reconstruction; from the small farmers, trapped into growing nothing but cotton, to the new industries of Birmingham; from abuse and intimacy in the family to tumultuous public meetings of the prohibitionists. He explores every aspect of society, politics, and the economy, detailing the importance of each in the emerging New South. Here is the local Baptist congregation, the country store, the tobacco-stained second-class railroad car, the rise of Populism: the teeming, nineteenth-century South comes to life in these pages. And central to the entire story is the role of race relations, from alliances and friendships between blacks and whites to the spread of Jim Crow laws and disenfranchisement. Ayers weaves all these details into the contradictory story of the New South, showing how the region developed the patterns it was to follow for the next fifty years. When Edward Ayers published Vengeance & Justice, a landmark study of crime and punishment in the nineteenth-century South, he received universal acclaim. Now he provides an unforgettable account of the New South - a land with one foot in the future and the other in the past.",

They had migrated west with capital, credit, and know-how, and their family-based businesses were extensions of family businesses in the east. They distinguished themselves in educational, leadership, and civic positions. Predominantly German Jews through the 1880's, their remoteness and small numbers encouraged the practice of Reform Judaism, which in turn increased their interaction with non-Jews and hastened the erosion of their heritage. The arrival of conservative Jews from Eastern Europe after the 1880's brought tension into the Wichita Jewish community, but also stirred an ethnoreligious revival. The German Jews were well-respected in the Wichita community, which facilitated the integration of the Eastern European newcomers. The Jewish community was characterized by a \"dynamic tension\" between tradition and modernization.",

		"event-place": "New York",
		"abstract": "Rachel Felix (1821-58), the homely daughter of poor Jewish peddlers, was the first stage actress to achieve international stardom - and the last person one would have expected to resurrect the cultural patrimony of France. Yet her passionate, startling performances of the works of Racine and Corneille saved them from almost certain obsolescence after the fall of Napoleon (who had relished classical French tragedy) and the emergence of Romanticism. Audiences in Paris, London, Boston, and Moscow thrilled to her voice, and devoured the rumors of her offstage promiscuity and extravagance. Her fame - equal parts popularity and notoriety - was so great that she could nonchalantly dispose of her last name. La grande Rachel virtually invented the role of the superstar, while remaining a symbol of the highest art and most serious cultural pursuits. Indeed, her identity was fraught with such contradictions - which intrigued the public all the more. From the moment she was discovered playing the guitar on the streets of Lyons, to her debut on the Parisian stage at the age of fifteen, to her critical and commercial triumphs as Camille, Phedre, and other tormented women, Rachel's career was exhaustively \"managed.\" A series of theater gurus, influential reviewers, and impresarios - including her brash and opportunistic father - claimed the credit for her astonishing success. What this abundance of male managers has always obscured is Rachel's own decisiveness and control over her time and money - not only did she play her various champions (and high-profile lovers) against one another, she openly defied them. Some called her stubborn, even perverse; in these pages, we come to recognize her as a woman ahead of her time, a charismatic individual very much in charge of her own destiny. As her fascination with all things Napoleonic suggests, Rachel liked power - both personal and professional - and had the talent to command it. This remarkable biography (Rachel Brownstein's first book since the acclaimed Becoming a Heroine) explores the themes of Rachel's brief, intense life and appropriately tragic death, as well as her afterlife as a character in novels and a figure of legend. Rachel's appearances - more or less disguised - in Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, and Henry James are crucial to an understanding of her profound appeal. Combining brilliant literary analysis with impeccable historical research, favoring thematic coherence and narrative imagination over a strictly chronological treatment, Brownstein delivers the full impact of Rachel's personality and the full significance of her accomplishments.",

		"abstract": "A single theme is pursued in this book - the trade between peoples of differing cultures through world history. Extending from the ancient world to the coming of the commercial revolution, Professor Curtin's discussion encompasses a broad and diverse group of trading relationships. Drawing on insights from economic history and anthropology, Professor Curtin has attempted to move beyond a Europe-centred view of history, to one that can help us understand the entire range of societies in the human past. Examples have been chosen that illustrate the greatest variety of trading relationships between cultures. The opening chapters look at Africa, while subsequent chapters treat the ancient world, the Mediterranean trade with China, the Asian trade in the east, and European entry into the trade with maritime Asia, the Armenian trade carriers of the seventeenth century, and the North American fur trade. Wide-ranging in its concern and the fruit of exhaustive research, the book is nevertheless written so as to be accessible and stimulating to the specialist and the student alike. -- Publishers description.",

		"event-place": "New York",
		"abstract": "Is antisemitism on the rise in America? A glance at the daily newspapers suggests a resurgence of animosity yet Leonard Dinnerstein, in this provocative and in-depth study, categorically states that there is less bigotry in this country than ever before. He also argues in this provocative analysis that Jews have never been more at home in America. What we are seeing today, he writes, is media hype. A long tradition of prejudice, suspicion, and hatred against the Jews, the direct product of Christian teachings, has, in fact, finally begun to wane. In Antisemitism in America, Dinnerstein provides a landmark work - the first comprehensive history of prejudice against Jews in the United States, ranging from its foundations in European Christian culture to the present day. Dinnerstein's richly detailed and thoroughly documented book reveals how Christians carried their religious prejudices with them to the New World and how they manifested themselves, albeit in muted form, in the colonial wilderness and in the developing American society thereafter. Jews could not vote, for example, in Rhode Island or New Hampshire until 1842, and in North Carolina until 1868. The Civil War witnessed the first major wave of publicly displayed American antisemitism as individuals in both the North and the South assumed that Jews sided with the enemy. The decades that followed marked the emergence of a full-fledged antisemitic society as Christians excluded Jews from their social circles and wove fantasies for themselves as they pictured what \"Jews were really like.\" Antisemitic fervor mixed with racism at the beginning of the twentieth century, accelerated by the views of eugenicists, fears of Bolshevism, and the rantings of Henry Ford. During the Depression hostility toward Jews accelerated as Americans vented their frustrations upon minorities because of the economic crises of the decade. Christians of all stripes called upon Jews to accept the divinity of Jesus Christ, and Father Charles Coughlin emerged as one of the most beloved priests in all of American history as he excoriated Jews and sympathized with Nazis over the airwaves and in his journal, Social Justice. Ironically, Dinnerstein writes, as Americans fought in World War II to make the world safe for democracy, public opinion polls noted a huge increase in American animosity toward Jews. Not until after the war ended did this enmity subside. While fresh economic opportunities and, heightened sensitivities to the effects of bigotry resulted in the decline of all prejudices in this country, including antisemitism, it nevertheless still cropped up in the highest ranks of government. especially during Richard Nixon's presidency. Within this volume, Dinnerstein not only chronicles the growth, demise and manifestations of antisemitism on the national scene but devotes individual chapters, as well, to the South and to African Americans, showing that prejudice among both whites and blacks below the Mason-Dixon line flowed from the same stream of Southern evangelical Christianity. \"It must also be emphasized,\" Dinnerstein writes, \"that in no Christian country has antisemitism been weaker than it has been in the United States,\" with its traditions of tolerance, diversity, and a secular national government. This book, however, reveals in disturbing detail the resilience, and vehemence, of this ugly prejudice. Penetrating, authoritative, and frequently alarming, this is the definitive account of a plague that apparently has a life of its own.",

Although the town declined when gold mining ended, several Jewish families started farms in the area, most notably Charles and Annie Greenberg. In 1914, another group arrived to form the Ferry County Farming and Stock Raising Company. In the end, the land proved unprofitable for farming, and most of the Jewish families left, unable to make a living or pay back loans. In its heyday the Jewish community at Republic had some 25 families, but it lacked the resources to make a permanent settlement.",

		"event-place": "University Park",
		"abstract": "\"In 1897 the Berwind-White Coal Mining Company founded Windber as a company town for its miners in the bituminous coal country of Pennsylvania. The Miners of Windber chronicles the coming of unionization to Windber, from the 1890s, when thousands of new immigrants flooded Pennsylvania in search of work, through the New Deal era of the 1930s, when the miners' rights to organize, to join the United Mine Workers of America, and to bargain collectively were recognized after years of bitter struggle.\" \"Mildred Allen Beik, a Windber native whose father entered the coal mines at age eleven in 1914, explores the struggle of miners and their families against the company, whose repressive policies encroached on every part of their lives. That Windber's population represented twenty-five different nationalities, including Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles, Italians, and Carpatho-Russians, was a potential obstacle to the solidarity of miners. Beik, however, shows how the immigrants overcame ethnic fragmentation by banding together as a class to unionize the mines. Work, family, church, fraternal societies, and civic institutions all proved critical as men and women alike adapted to new working conditions and to a new culture.\" \"Beik draws on a wide variety of sources, including oral histories gathered from thirty-five of the oldest living immigrants in Windber, foreign-language newspapers, fraternal society collections, church manuscripts, public documents, union records, and census materials. The struggles of Windber's diverse working class undeniably mirror the efforts of working people everywhere to democratize the undemocratic America they knew.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

		"abstract": "Scholars have long explored the role that reputation plays in the facilitation of exchange. Some attention has also been paid to the way in which religions serve as a proxy for reputation or as a mechanism for enforcement of exchange agreements. These reputation and enforcement mechanisms enhance the ability of the members of certain religious groups to perform economic roles where such secular-based mechanisms fail or are absent. In this article, I explore the ways in which hostility toward members of high-tension religions makes them uniquely well suited to the economic role of middlemen. As illustration, I explore the particular case of the 19th-century German Jewish peddler in the young United States.",

		"abstract": "\"The Mellah Society is a compact yet detailed and fascinating account of Jewish life in precolonial Morocco, based on the voluminous but rarely studied writings of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Judeo-Moroccan sages. Shlomo Deshen, author of several books on North African Jewish immigrants to Israel, here turns his attention to the past. Taking as his focus the tension between individualism and communal authority -- symbolized by the walls of the mellahs, the Jewish quarters -- he applies to traditional Moroccan Jewish society questions of concern to sociologists everywhere regarding political organization, economic activity, religion, and the family. From such documents as private correspondence, archival photographs, and the legal commentaries of rabbis who served in the Jewish community courts, Deshen draws out details of daily life: disputes between spouses, businessmen, craftsmen, and inheritors; the ramifications of marriage contracts; and claims involving community taxes and extortions by Muslim potentates. Linking this material with recent historical and anthropological studies of the Maghreb, Deshen reconstructs a community about which little has been known and places it squarely within the context of traditional Moroccan society. Individual chapters deal with relations between Muslims and Jews, the material conditions of Jewish life, and the nature of politics within the mellah. Deshen devotes particular attention to the nature of the Moroccan rabbinate, the sociology of the mellah synagogue, lay community leadership, and the historic role of the Sephardic heritage in Morocco after the expulsion from medieval Spain. His close study of the nature of the extended family in traditional Morocco corrects popular misconceptions. Originally published in Israel in 1983, now translated and expanded by its author, The Mellah Society draws upon Middle Eastern and Jewish history, textual Judaic studies, and social anthropology to make an original contribution that will interest scholars of the Middle East and North Africa as well as anyone concerned with Jewish history and ethnicity.\"--Back cover.",

Focus on this period allows consideration of a world in which economic and political connections are becoming global, in which an unprecedented range of goods and services are on offer, and in which the old political structures are first subverted and then radically modified. The Age of Enlightenment is transmuted into the first Age of Consumption.\" \"The present volume, the first of three, is the result of a unique collaboration between twenty-six leading subject specialists from Europe and North America. The outcome is a new interpretation of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, one that shapes a new historical landscape based on the consumption of goods and services.\"--Jacket.",

Eleven leading thinkers in the field examine antisemitism in Canada, from the colonial era to the present day, in essays which reflect the saga of the nation itself. The history of the Jewish community, its struggles and its fortunes, is mirrored in the wider history of Canada, from Confederation to the present.\" \"The contributors cast light on Canadian antisemitism through a thorough examination of old and new tensions, including Anglo-French, east-west and Jewish-Ukrainian relations. Attitudes to Jews in pre-Confederation Canada, French Canada from Confederation to World War I as well as the interwar years, and in twentieth-century Ontario and Alberta from 1880-1950 are illustrated in various chapters.\" \"Of particular interest are the examinations of such well-known figures as Goldwin Smith, the greatly admired liberal historian of Victorian Canada, Adrien Arcand, the would-be Fuhrer from Quebec, and James Keegstra and Ernst Zundel, of more recent notoriety. Analyses are also provided of Nazism and Canadian Protestantism and Jewish-Ukrainian relations since World War II.\" \"This is a complex and contentious subject; yet to understand the ideas and forces that have sought to undermine the Jewish presence in Canada is to understand the dangers that threaten any democratic society, and thereby to guard against them.\" \"This compelling collection of essays offers intelligent, readable accounts of an area of Canadian history about which we know too little.\"--Jacket.",

		"event-place": "New York",
		"abstract": "The many thousands of Jews from German-speaking lands who came to the United States throughout the nineteenth century played a major part in laying the foundations of the Jewish community in America. The author considers these immigrants a branch of German Jewry, compelled to seek overseas the political and civil rights denied them at home. In this volume of the Ellis Island Series, the fascinating story of this mass immigration of mostly poor, enterprising, young people is told in vivid detail. Drawing on rare letters, diaries, memoirs, period newspapers, journals, and other firsthand accounts, Barkai traces the process of family-oriented chain migration, resettlement, and acculturation, exploring as well the group's relations with the Jewish community in Germany and with German and Jewish immigrants in the New World. Often starting out as peddlers and storekeepers, the immigrants moved back and forth from East Coast towns and cities to settlements in the South, Midwest, and Far West, helping to expand the American frontier and to develop cities such as Cincinnati St. Louis, Milwaukee, and San Francisco. The narrative chronicles their experiences in the goldfields of California, on Indian reservations, and during the Civil War, in which German-Jewish soldiers in the Union and Confederate armies struggled against bigotry to assert their civil rights. These engaging personal narratives are woven into an account of the formative role played by German-Jewish immigrants in establishing the institutional framework of the American-Jewish community. Their influential network of mutual aid and philanthropic organizations would be challenged, at the turn of the century, by the great mass migration of Jews from Eastern Europe. The author's presentation of the dramatic encounter between these two groups sheds new light not only on this critical period in American-Jewish history but also on the dynamics of cultural change in a pluralist society.",

		"abstract": "In this book Ira Berlin traces the history of African-American slavery in the United States from its beginnings in the seventeenth century to its demise nearly three hundred years later. Most Americans, black and white, have a singular vision of slavery, one fixed in the mid-nineteenth century when most American slaves grew cotton, resided in the deep South, and subscribed to Christianity. Here, however, Berlin offers a major reinterpretation in which slaves and their owners continually renegotiated the terms of captivity. Slavery was thus made and remade by successive generations of Africans and African Americans who lived through settlement and adaptation, plantation life, economic transformations, revolution, forced migration, war, and ultimately, emancipation. Berlin's understanding of the processes that continually transformed the lives of slaves makes Generations of captivity essential reading for anyone interested in the evolution of antebellum America. Connecting the \"Charter Generation\" to the development of Atlantic society in the seventeenth century, the \"Plantation Generation\" to the reconstruction of colonial society in the eighteenth century, the \"Revolutionary Generation\" to the Age of Revolutions, and the \"Migration Generation\" to American expansionism in the nineteenth century, Berlin integrates the history of slavery into the larger story of American life. He demonstrates how enslaved black people, by adapting to changing circumstances, prepared for the moment when they could seize liberty and declare themselves the \"Freedom Generation.\" This epic story provides a rich understanding of the experience of African-American slaves, an experience that continues to mobilize American thought and passions today.",

		"abstract": "OLD FORGE \"\" Memorable smells of paint and oiled rope co-mingle with pine soap and lilac right where the old floorboards stop creaking underfoot.\n\nWind chimes ring in a wind of shoppers a few storerooms away.\n\nAn old-fashioned candy corner is striped red, pink, blue, green, purple and chocolate.\n\nThe treats occupy a front window with wide-mouth glass jars that attract children's fingers like insects to sticky flypaper.\n\nPans full of smooth stones give them something to dig around in. Lilac and pine smells fade to mint.\n\nPeople stand idly cocked against one hip, shopping baskets as counterbalance.\n\nThe cash register drawer closes with a frequent snap.\n\nSomehow, at Old Forge Hardware, commerce promises more than general merchandise.\n\nThree generations of family ownership through 107 years of sales add a kind of museum quality to the place.\n\nNostalgia drifts on neatly stacked shelves, not to mention from unending rows and subsequent rooms \"\" each different, each unique \"\" under one roof.\n\nThere are no slick white UPC-coded labels here.\n\nEvery hand-selected item is tagged with an orange sticker: dollars and cents, no dollar sign.\n\nFor \"3.00,\" you can buy a replica copy of the Declaration of Independence or the U.S. Constitution or the Gettysburg Address.\n\n\"God forbid you're looking for one thing,\" a customer coos.\n\n\"This place is huge.\"\n\nHuge is understated.\n\nThere are maps of Old Forge Hardware.\n\nBut if you are looking for one thing, it's probably here; and help is not far away.\n\nSomewhere between the books deep in the belly of the store, past walls full of fine woolen yarn, Linda Cohen walks through the rows calling.\n\n\"Anyone need help with anything? Can we find something for you?\"\n\nHer comforting voice drifts like a peddler's over the shelves.\n\nThe customers come here, though.\n\nThey walk miles up one aisle and down another.\n\nThey come by the busload and fill the parking lot beside the village green.\n\nSarah Cohen joins in, strolling in a long jeans dress accented with a red-seed necklace.\n\n\"Can I help anyone find something?\"\n\nCustomers smile, not needing assistance.\n\nThey covet the browse.\n\nThe sisters drift to one corner of the bookstore and pour a cup of coffee (decaf) to tell their story.\n\n\"Well, I've brought this down,\" Sarah said. \"It's a copy of the first lease grampa signed, dated 1901.\"\n\nAnd there, under glass, are two yellow pages written in long, brown script.\n\n\"It's pretty funny when you take time to read it,\" Sarah says, and begins aloud.\n\nLinda joins in, helping where one phrase is crossed out and another written in above it.\n\nFor $20 per month, E.F. Abbott let a store space for a \"hardware business,\" which is crossed out and redefined as a \"General Store \"\" only.\"\n\nThe cautious landlord wanted to keep the larger stall in the barn for himself (or a horse), and wanted to be reimbursed for the last two inches of coal in the stove.\n\n\"I am also to have access to front room, so as to get water and get to the cellar,\" Abbott wrote.\n\nTwo payments of $120 apiece were required, six months rent at a time.\n\nThe revised deal left the new storekeeper one-half the coal for free.\n\nIt is signed: Moses Cohen above E.F. Abbott.\n\n\"That is most certainly grampa's signature,\" Sarah said.\n\n\"But his name is spelled wrong in the contract,\" Linda said.\n\nAbbott wrote \"Moses Cohn\" throughout the document.\n\nMoses Cohen was 17, about the late 1880s, when he fled Lithuania.\n\n\"He left to escape the draft. The Russian czar always sent Jews to the front lines,\" Sarah informed, sitting, hands folded.\n\nMoses Cohen went first to Dannemora, then to Bloomingdale where his brother, David, was selling household items door-to-door.\n\n\"They were peddlers,\" Sarah said. Her eyes sparkled.\n\nIn a short while, the brothers Cohen realized the territory was too small for both of them, so Moses shifted a little west and south.\n\nHe sold his things in a big pack worn on his back.\n\nIt opened with pockets for things like needles and thread and cups.\n\n\"But the peddler's wagon at the Adirondack Museum in NOT my grandfather's,\" Sarah said.\n\nMoses Cohen traveled as far as he could walk in one day, from Tupper Lake south.\n\n\"He had a whole network of people he would stay with,\" Linda added, her words syncopated for a few seconds with the end of her sister's sentence.\n\n\"In 1901, signing a lease with a Mr. Abbott in Old Forge was a very big deal.\"\n\nThe sisters continued in alternating phrase.\n\nMoses Cohen rented a basement space in the old Forge House, a local inn.\n\nSarah and Linda have copies of old newspaper pages where their grandfather advertised as a peddler and a tinsmith.\n\nThe store breaks into the story as customers stop in.\n\nThe sisters never hesitate to help.\n\nA line forms from time to time this day, with Harry Potter's last book due out in 48 hours.\n\nA deliveryman wheels a dolly past with four red-banded cases of books.\n\nLinda sighed with relief.\n\n\"There they are.\"\n\nThe boxes stamped \"Harry Potter\" hold 100 of the fresh-inked pages.\n\nThe delivery caught the eye of a teen browsing nearby.\n\n\"Mom!\" he hissed in disbelief.\n\nThe books are embargoed under a multi-layered contract requiring signatures in triplicate. They go on sale to the public Saturday morning, just like everywhere else in the world.\n\nThe sisters stop talking history to decide how to handle the growing Harry Potter wait list.\n\nThey discuss it in overlapping conversation.\n\nThe answer precipitates out.\n\n\"Index cards, then we can pull it when someone comes to get their books,\" Linda says.\n\n\"We're only putting 85 of the copies on the waiting list,\" Sarah said.\n\nThe remaining 15 go on the shelf, dedicated to free enterprise.\n\nThe sprawling, three-building complex occupies one block in the village of Old Forge, population 1,000.\n\nThe fire station is next door.\n\nWhen the whistle blows, the windows shudder.\n\n\"It's been like that forever,\" said Danielle Hoepfl, whose great uncle, Ken Rivette, was a close friend of Moses Cohen.\n\nHoepfl manages the knitting supply and bookstores.\n\nIt's raining hard outside, two days before the last Harry Potter release.\n\nOld Forge is at peak summer tourist season; more than 10 times its population is in town.\n\nAnd the store is full of people, everywhere, in streams.\n\nBut they don't get lost.\n\n\"We have to be careful when we lock up at night,\" Hoepfl said.\n\nShe loves coming to work everyday.\n\n\"I always tell people, if we don't have it, they don't need it.\"\n\nShe listens after the fire whistle; she's a level-three critical care EMT, one of four in the area with the nearest hospital an hour away. She might be called out.\n\nCivic duty is honored in this workplace.\n\n\"They never question me when I say I have to go. They never dock my pay. They know how important community service is in a small town.\"\n\nLinda comes through the door in a rush.\n\n\"Come! You should see what the bookstore looks like!\"\n\nThe children's book section is abuzz with small people sprawled against the racks, looking at books, stacking blocks. Parents are crouched down with them, murmuring.\n\nThe floor is awash in new books, but the sisters love the sight of it. Like an eggbeater went through it.\n\nThe sisters talk about their father, A. Richard, and mother, Judith.\n\nTheir father, a Harvard student, and mother with a master's degree in social work, started running the store during the depression.\n\nA. Richard started a number of other successful businesses in Old Forge including a grocery store, a liquor store, several real estate companies and the Enchanted Forest (with partners) that have since been sold.\n\nBut not Old Forge Hardware.\n\nWhere rural economics have closed other places, this one survived. Even McDonald's closed in Old Forge a few years ago because there wasn't enough business.\n\n\"It's the general store that keeps us going,\" Linda said.\n\n\"We are very fortunate in the manager we had for 50 years, and in the manager, Mike Wilcox, we have now,\" Sarah said.\n\nThere has been no real overhead for decades.\n\nAnd inventory levels are flush.\n\n\"This is a mature business,\" Sarah said. \"So many businesses change hands, it's hard to get past debt service.\"\n\nIt's an oft-overlooked benefit of local ownership, one hard pressed to survive in the world of chain stores.\n\n\"An advantage of not being a chain store is that we don't have to adhere to an authorized inventory. We can bring in the oddball items,\" Sarah said.\n\nMost notable among those \"\" a sprinkler top that fits a soda bottle for ironing, red long johns, bark boxes, watermelon-rind pickles in an Old Forge Hardware label, beds, life jackets, sinks and sink strainers, fishing lures.\n\nThere are, however, kegs of nails in the cellar, merchandise left since 1922 or thereabouts, when the store was rebuilt after a fire.\n\nIt likely never would have occurred to Moses Cohen that his two granddaughters would eventually run the store.\n\n\"There are days when I feel like I've been here the 107 years,\" Sarah said, laughing.\n\nIn a way, they have.",

S. Donnelly, Jr, T.W. Heyck, J.L. Altholz and the two editors themselves reflect on various implications of Larkin's 'Devotional Revolution' thesis which argues that it was only in the mid nineteenth century that the church made 'practising Catholics' of the Irish people.\" \"J. J. Lee, Donal Kerr, H.F. Kearney, G.I. Bernstein, L.W. McBride and F.A. Biletz deal with issues arising out of his 'Church, State and Nation' thesis which suggests that several decades before an Irish state achieved de jure independence the church had entered into a 'concordat' with a de facto Irish state. I.J. McCaffrey and Helen Mulvey contribute a memoir and bibliography of the honouree.\"--Jacket.",

		"abstract": "Founded in 1841, the Jewish Chronicle is the oldest continuously published Jewish newspaper in the world. A force for change, a forum for debate and a shaper of Jewish identity; it has played a central part in the development of modern Anglo-Jewry; More than just a mirror of Anglo-Jewish life, registering waves of immigration and social change, the JC has been an active player in historical events. Its editors have intervened decisively in communal history and debated with British statesmen. Once a fierce opponent of Zionism, the paper became its strongest champion. At the time of the Balfour Declaration, Jewish, British and world history intersected in its pages. So important was its influence that in 1947 the directors sacked the editor because they feared his belligerent articles on Palestine would cause anti-Semitism. No historian can understand the inner life of British Jews without looking at the social reports, the sports column, arts and cultural coverage and the advertising that the paper has carried. This book gives an insight into the working of a newspaper, the struggles between editors and directors and the boardroom politics. It is the story of a publishing adventure that became an institution and helped to shape the destiny of an entire community.",

Bushman makes clear that the quest for gentility, far from being trivial, was the serious pursuit of a personal and social ideal with sources in classical and Renaissance literature. In Europe, the growing interest in manners and beautiful environments was connected to the power of royal courts. In America, the transformation of architecture, furnishings, and wardrobes - from plain, rudimentary, and frugal, to decorative and sumptuous - was linked to the transfer of power to the colonial gentry. Gentility was the culture of the colonies' ruling elite. After the Revolution, gentility spread to a broad middle class, as an essentially aristocratic culture was democratized. The change affected nearly every aspect of life. The spread of gentility turned the conduct of ordinary people into a performance. Courtesy books taught people how to hold their bodies, and how to dress, eat, and converse in a pleasing way. The wish to be pleasing came to encompass virtually every form of behavior and every aspect of the physical environment, from houses and yards to public buildings and the adornment of streets. Factories sprang up to supply a vast new market for furniture, dishes, curtains, and carpets. Cities and towns planted trees, landscaped parks and greens, and erected fashionable hotels and churches. All of these developments were part of a vast effort to present a refined face to the world and to create a new kind of society. Bushman stresses that these visions of a more elegant life both complemented and competed with other American values associated with evangelical religion, republicanism, capitalism, and the work ethic. The melding with other values resulted in contradictions that were not easily resolved and that provided much cultural work for writers and theologians. Finally, he argues that gentility gained strength from collaboration with capitalism, but in a way that blunted class conflict. The combination of capitalism, republicanism, and gentility prevented the hardening of class consciousness. Instead there emerged a belief in the right of every citizen to membership in the middle class.",

Why have the middle classes developed so passionate an attachment to the contents of their homes? This book offers surprising answers to these questions, uncovering the roots of today's consumer society and investigating the forces that shape consumer desires. Richly illustrated, Household Gods chronicles one hundred years of British interiors, focusing on class, choice, shopping and possessions. Exploring a wealth of unusual records and archives, Deborah Cohen locates the source of modern consumerism and materialism in early nineteenth-century religious fervour. Over the course of the Victorian era, consumerism shed the taint of sin to become the pre-eminent means of expressing individuality. The book ranges from musty antique shops to luxurious emporia, from suburban semi-detached houses to elegant city villas, from husbands fretting about mantelpieces to women appropriating home decoration as a feminist cause. It uncovers a society of consumers whose identities have become entwined with the things they put in their houses.\"--Jacket.",

		"abstract": "As economic crises struck the Third World in the 1970's and 1980's, large segments of the population turned to the informal economy to survive. Though this phenomenon has previously been analyzed from a strictly economic point of view, this book looks at street vending in the largest city in the world, Mexico City, as a political process. Employing a street-level analysis based on intensive participant observation, with interviews, archival research, and surveys, the author gives a view of political processes that provides new theoretical insights into our understanding of social movements, state institutions, and politics at the fringe of society, where legality blurs into illegality and the informal economy intersects with its political counterpoint - informal politics. By studying political processes at the street level and then tracing them up the political structure, the author also reveals the basic processes by which the Mexican state operates.",

Now, for the first time, a comprehensive, lavishly illustrated history of the Jews of Boston recounts their stories and marks their achievements. Comprising twelve essays by eleven expert scholars, The Jews of Boston traces the community from its early, tentative beginnings through its emergence in the 20th century as one of America's most influential Jewish communities. Six historical essays detail Boston's unique history as a late-developing but extraordinarily successful American Jewish community. Essays on Boston's synagogues, its Jewish neighborhoods, and its role in Zionism feature discussions by the new generation of American Jewish historians. Assessments of philanthropy, education, and intellectual life evaluate those movements' pioneering roles in the evolution of Jewish culture in Boston and America. Beautifully illustrated with more than 250 historic photographs, engravings, and documents - many of them published here for the first time - The Jews of Boston will serve for years to come as the reference work on Boston Jewish history.",

		"abstract": "The army sutler was a civilian who sold comestibles and small wares to men under arms. In America, as in Europe, sutlers were originally camp followers, but when the army realized that these men helped stabilize frontier military life, suttling became a formal military support activity. During the course of the nineteenth century, the suttling trade increased in complexity and profitability, and attracted a number of opportunists. Although sutlers provided a much-needed service, these men illegally sold whiskey to soldiers and Indians, and during President Grant's administration a number of suttling slots were peddled by officials to the highest bidder. The ranks of sutlers peaked during the Civil War, but the position was then abolished because of their scandalous wartime activities. Reinstated In 1867 to fill the needs of emigrants, suttling remained active until the end of the century, when it was replaced by the post exchange (PX). Author David Delo examines the changing nature of sutlery and its practitioners during the nineteenth century and shows how history has emphasized sutlers' disruptive behavior without giving due credit to their contributions as entrepreneurs. This is an accessible work on an important group of figures in American history.",
