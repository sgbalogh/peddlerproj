            <p class="firstpara">Welcome to the “The Jewish Peddler,” a companion website to NYU professor Hasia Diner’s book <em>Roads Taken: The Great Jewish Migrations to the New World and the Peddlers Who Forged the Way</em>. This site is a project of NYU Libraries and currently under construction. When completed, it will provide visitors with an opportunity to explore themes presented by the book through digitized resources, geographic visualizations, and a database to locate further resources. It will provide a point of exploration beyond the materials represented in <em>Roads Taken</em>.</p>
          
            <p>The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw a great migration of the Jewish people. Facing persecution, poverty, conscription, or limited economic options, these immigrants sought a better life in a diverse set of destinations including the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Latin America, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia. </p>
            <p>The first-generation peddler was a fixture among Jewish immigrants around the world, and remarkably similar models of business and cultural acclimation emerged across destinations. Shortly after arrival, the peddler to be would be in contact with a wholesaler. These established merchants were often family members or landsleit (people originating in the same town or region), and often they too had started as a peddler. Armed with goods and a territory, the new peddler would traverse the sparsely-populated countryside, burgeoning frontier towns, or city streets. In the process, they learned about their new communities and cultural exchange often accompanied commercial interactions. The peddler needed to learn enough of their customers’ language to make the sale. Being far from home, many peddlers found shelter in their customers homes after plying their wares. At the same time, the peddlers often provided isolated customers with news and gave many customers their first contact with Jewish culture. Due to the low overhead of peddling, the peddlers were able to offer customers competitive deals, and their activities coincided with a period of increased consumption of material goods across social classes.</p>
            <p>The business model of peddling allowed many to translate hard work, thrift, and luck into profit and upward mobility. Traveling on foot with goods upon their backs could lead to purchasing a wagon. Enough success could lead to owning a store or pave the way for other career opportunities for the peddler and their children. For many who took up the pack, time on the road provided the cultural familiarity, language skills, and social capital to take on an active role in the communities in which they settled.</p>
